# Linkkit — project summary

_Last updated: 2026-10-05, v0.0.4 (after step 5)_

## What it is

A browser widget for "what does this depend on?" maps: boxes connected by
arrows, where A → B means "A needs B". Click a box and everything it needs
lights up teal, everything that breaks without it lights up orange. For
concept maps, dependency maps and relationship maps. Mouse-first, for
normal users. Sibling of Boardkit, Treekit and Vennkit, whose stack and
look it mirrors; built and used on its own. Repo:
github.com/AlexLCBranco/linkkit; every push to main deploys on Vercel
(https://linkkit-lake.vercel.app). Behaviour reference:
`reference/prototype.html`.

## Stack

Vite, React 19, TypeScript (strict), Zustand, React Flow (`@xyflow/react`)
as the renderer (camera locked: no pan, no zoom; the page scrolls
natively), a small hand-written layout (no layout library), CSS Modules +
design tokens (copied from Treekit) for the page, Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui
(Radix) for menus and dialogs, lucide icons. No backend: saved in the
browser's localStorage. Layers: `app -> features -> components -> store ->
domain`; `domain/` is pure TypeScript with Vitest tests.

## What works now

- Dark header (with the map's name and an "Add box" button), status line,
  version badge
- The page: a sheet of dotted paper with the map's boxes and arrows on
  it. Boxes look like Treekit's nodes (wrap past 220px, palette colours
  show as a tint); arrows are straight lines from box edge to box edge
  with an arrowhead, and their label in a small pill. Labels of crossing
  arrows slide along their arrow so they don't pile up
- First visit: the Microsoft 365 sign-in example appears already tidied
  (boxes measured out of sight, Tidy up runs once, then they show)
- Saved automatically in the browser; a reload reopens the same map where
  it was. A damaged save is repaired and the original kept aside
- Click a box: what it needs lights up teal, what breaks without it
  lights up orange (boxes fill, arrows on those paths turn colour and
  thicken), everything else fades, and the status line shows the box's
  name and both counts. A box both needed and broken (in a loop) shows
  teal and counts only under "Needs". Box colours step aside while the
  highlight shows. Click empty paper or press Escape to clear it. The
  selection is not saved: a reload starts with nothing selected
- Editing with the mouse (keys are only extras):
  - Add: double-click empty paper (the box appears there), or "Add box"
    in the header (the middle of the part of the page on screen, stepped
    aside if a box is already there). The new box opens its name for
    typing; Enter or clicking away keeps it, and a box left without a
    name disappears
  - Rename: double-click a box, or the pencil in its hover toolbar.
    Emptying a name keeps the old one
  - Move: drag a box; it stays on the page. A box that grows past the
    page's edge (a longer name) moves back onto it
  - Connect: drag the dot on a box's right edge onto another box. A
    dashed arrow follows the pointer and snaps to a box it may connect
    to; letting go anywhere else does nothing
  - Arrow labels: click a label to type a new one (emptied, it goes back
    to "needs"); the × on its corner deletes the arrow
  - Delete a box (and its arrows): the bin in its hover toolbar, or
    select it and press Delete
  - Two arrows between the same boxes in opposite directions are drawn
    side by side instead of on top of each other
- The engine underneath, all in `src/domain/` with tests: the map model
  (boxes with a centre position and an optional colour, arrows with a
  label), the one place that decides which arrows are allowed, "needs /
  breaks" reach and the status-bar counts, a loop-safe Tidy-up layout,
  page sizing (keeping boxes on the page, a free spot for a new box),
  arrow geometry (with side-by-side opposite arrows) and label placement,
  saving with a version
  number and repair of damaged saves, and the example map

## What's next

The first build, in order:
1. ~~Scaffold~~ (done)
2. ~~Domain + tests~~ (done)
3. ~~The page: boxes and arrows, the example map tidied on first load~~
   (done)
4. ~~Click a box: teal needs / orange breaks highlight and the status bar~~
   (done)
5. ~~Editing with the mouse: add, rename, connect, move, delete, arrow
   labels~~ (done)
6. Page: "More room" tab, corner grip, animated Tidy up
7. Undo/redo, then box colours (right-click menu, swatch row, keys 1–8 / 0)
8. Several saved maps: switcher, rename, new, duplicate, delete, "Add
   example map" (replaces the prototype's "Reset example": it adds a
   fresh example map and never wipes one)
9. Polish and a full check against the "done when" list

## Open problems

- Treekit's teal and orange box colours look like the needs / breaks
  highlights. Decided: keep all 8; a selected box's highlight hides box
  colours, and the highlight looks different (solid fill, coloured arrows,
  the rest faded). Revisit if it still confuses in use.
- Look choices made in step 3 where the prototype and Treekit differ
  (Treekit's look won, per CLAUDE.md): boxes wrap long names instead of
  growing forever; arrow labels have a thin border; the page is centred
  on the screen rather than left-aligned. Easy to change if unwanted.
- Look choices made in step 4 (Treekit's look won): the selected box
  keeps Treekit's selection style (accent border, thin ring) rather than
  the prototype's thicker ring; highlights fade in over a moment.
- Look choices made in step 5 (Treekit's look won): deleting and
  renaming a box sit in Treekit's hover toolbar above the box (the
  prototype had a × on the box's corner); boxes show Treekit's open-hand
  cursor. Kept from the prototype: the connect dot on the box's right
  edge, single-click to edit a label, the × on a label's corner.
- Step 5 additions beyond the prototype: opposite arrows are drawn side
  by side (straight, slightly apart) rather than bent; "Add box" steps a
  new box aside rather than stacking it on another.
